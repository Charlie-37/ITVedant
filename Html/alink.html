                Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as
                its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
                projects.[30]

                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described
                as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.[31]

                Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming
                language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
                introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference
                counting. Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not
                completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33]

                Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.[34][35][36][37]

            <h1>Java</h1><br>
            <p>
                Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on
                all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically
                compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying
                computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities
                than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code
                modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was
                one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for
                client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]

                Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by
                Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and
                reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released
                by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java
                Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license.
                Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the
                OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for
                almost all Linux distributions.

                As of March 2021, the latest version is Java 16, with Java 11, a currently supported long-term support
                (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update for the
                legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use, although it will otherwise still support
                Java 8 with public updates for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer zero-cost
                builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still receiving security and other upgrades.

            <h1>Web Designing</h1><br>
            <p>
                Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of
                websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI
                design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX
                design); and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different
                aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.[1] The term "web design" is
                normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website
                including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web
                development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves
                creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.

            <h1>Back End</h1><br>
            <p>
                Back-end development, often called the “server-side”, is the part of an application that the user never
                sees. As the front-end code is what the user interacts with on a site, the back-end is responsible for
                what’s going on behind the curtain. Things like business logic, calculations, database interactions, and
                performance are included in the back-end.

                Behind the pretty face developed by the front-end code is the back-end code that makes the application
                work – creating a dynamic site that changes and updates in real-time.

                The back-end normally consists of an application, server and database. As you interact with a site by
                entering information, this information is stored in a database that resides on a server. Results are
                then returned to you to be displayed on the site as front-end code.

                One example of back-end development at work is the scenario of buying a plane ticket on a website.
                Everything you see on the site is the front-end. After you enter your request for flight options, the
                back-end takes over by sending the request to the database to look up the flight information, then puts
                together a web page that lists all the flight options and sends this page back to you. Once the data
                reaches your computer, the information is passed to the front-end to be displayed on the site.

                All the information you entered is stored in the database on the server, where it can be accessed and
                changed at any time. For instance, if you decide to change the date of the flight or cancel the order,
                the items in the database are changed to reflect this. If you log back into the application later on to
                print your ticket, all your information will still be there in your account.

                The server, application, and database all need to communicate smoothly in order for a function, like
                buying a plane ticket, to work. Back-end developers use server-side languages like Python, Ruby, Java,
                and PHP to build applications. They use tools like MySQL, SQL, and Oracle to connect to the database to
                find, save, and modify the data that is sent back to the user.
                As a back-end developer, you’re responsible for building and maintaining the technologies around the
                application, server, and database – ensuring that what the user interacts with on a site actually
                performs the functions it’s designed to do.
