WAP to explain else statement proper comments  with notes.

->Sometimes we might want to run a specific block of code. In that case, we can use else block with the try-except block. 
The else block will be executed if and only if there are no exception is the try block.
For these cases, we can use the optional else statement with the try statement.

*Why to use else block with try:
Use else statement with try block to check if try block executed without any exception or if you want to run a specific code only if an exception is not raised.

Syntax-
try:    
    # block of code     
except Exception1:    
    # block of code     
else:    
    # this code executes when exceptions not occured    

Example-
try:
    a = int(input("Enter value of a:"))
    b = int(input("Enter value of b:"))
    c = a / b
    print("a/b = %d" % c)

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Can't divide by zero")
else:
    print("We are in else block ")

Output1:
Enter value of a:24
Enter value of b:2
a/b = 12.0
We are in else block 

Output2:
Enter value of a:25
Enter value of b:0
Can't divide by zero
