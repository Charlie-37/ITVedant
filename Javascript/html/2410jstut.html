            Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its
            high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very
            attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect
            existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore
            reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program
            modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source
            or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

        <h1 class="abc">JavaScript</h1>
        <p class="abc">Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML
            pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't
            need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the
            pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies,
            detect a user’s browser, etc.</p>
            <div class="abc">Techopedia Explains JavaScript (JS)
                HTML pages are fine for displaying static content, e.g. a simple image or text. However, most pages
                nowadays are rarely static. Many of today’s pages have menus, forms, slideshows and even images that
                provide user interaction. Javascript is the language employed by web developers to provide such
                interaction. Since JavaScript works with HTML pages, a developer needs to know HTML to harness this
                scripting language’s full potential. While there are other languages that can be used for scripting on
                the Web, in practice it is essentially all Javascript.</div>
            
                <div class="abc">Without JavaScript, all you would have on the web would be HTML and CSS. These alone
                    limit you to a few web page implementations. 90% (if not more) of your webpages would be static, and
                    you'd only have the dynamic changes like animations that CSS provides.</div>
