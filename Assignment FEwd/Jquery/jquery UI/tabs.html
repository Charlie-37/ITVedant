            <p>The python language is one of the most accessible programming languages available because it has
                simplified syntax and not complicated, which gives more emphasis on natural language. Due to its ease of
                learning and usage, python codes can be easily written and executed much faster than other programming
                languages.</p>

        <div id="Java">
            <p>Java™ has significant advantages over other languages and environments that make it suitable for just
                about any programming task.

                The advantages of Java are as follows:

                Java is easy to learn.
                Java was designed to be easy to use and is therefore easy to write, compile, debug, and learn than other
                programming languages.

                Java is object-oriented.
                This allows you to create modular programs and reusable code.

                Java is platform-independent.
                One of the most significant advantages of Java is its ability to move easily from one computer system to
                another. The ability to run the same program on many different systems is crucial to World Wide Web
                software, and Java succeeds at this by being platform-independent at both the source and binary levels.

                Because of Java's robustness, ease of use, cross-platform capabilities and security features, it has
                become a language of choice for providing worldwide Internet solutions.</p>
